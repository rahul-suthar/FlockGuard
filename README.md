# 🐖🐓 BioFarm - Digital Farm Biosecurity Portal

A full-stack platform to help pig & poultry farmers implement biosecurity measures, detect diseases early, and receive timely alerts — empowering farmers with digital tools for healthier livestock and improved productivity.

## 🌍 Problem Statement (SIH25006)

Pig & poultry farms in India face devastating disease outbreaks like **Avian Influenza (bird flu)** and **African Swine Fever (ASF)**.
These outbreaks cause mass culling, huge economic losses, and threaten food security — with smallholder farmers most affected.

📉 Example losses:

- ₹25,000 crore annual poultry disease losses (HPAI).

- ₹982 crore ASF losses (2021–2025, across NE states).

- 69,000+ pigs dead, 52,000+ culled in 2025 alone.

## 🎯 Our Solution

### A Digital Farm Management Portal with:

- User Roles → Farmer, Vet, Pharmacy, Admin.

- Farm Profiles → Setup pig/poultry farms with details.

- AI Disease Detection → Farmers upload images → ML model predicts disease.

- Digital Health Reports → Store reports with predictions, vet notes, and prescriptions.

- Alerts & Notifications → Admin/vets push outbreak alerts based on region.

- Training Hub → Multilingual, mobile-first biosecurity training modules.

- Marketplace Link → Farmers can directly reach vets & pharmacies for medicines (revenue model).
